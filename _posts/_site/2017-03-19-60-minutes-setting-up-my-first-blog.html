<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>As far as I can remember, I created this blog 2 years ago, when Github “first” marketing its feature: <strong>github.io</strong> blog. I was so excited and tried it out right away. But umm… it was nothing more than a line <strong>Hello world</strong> in the index.html file.</p>

<p>Ok, let’s move on. I need to create a brand-new one.</p>

<h2 id="static-blog">Static blog</h2>

<p>I’ve heard about this term before but haven’t really spend time one it. After digging around 30 mins (sorry I lied about 60 mins…), I figured out some frameworks that I could use, including in Haskell - language I’ve recently interested in.</p>

<p>But hey, we need server for that right?… Ok, going back with thing provided by Github. Well, it’s Jekyll.</p>

<p>Let’s try it out!!!!</p>

<h2 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h2>
<p>Jekyll, in ….<strong>Ruby</strong>.</p>

<p>Googled a little bit more and <strong>bump</strong>! Everything is settled.</p>

<p>Yeah, like super easy peasy, you just need to copy all the files (or fork) the <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">jekyll-now</a> repo and you’re done!</p>

<p>I also installed <code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem</code> for ruby so that I can see my post in my local machine. Of course, I need that for reviewing my post, I know, I know, my post still have typos and grammar errors in 100 words above, and… below.</p>

<h2 id="custom-domain">Custom domain</h2>
<p>This one is hard. I’m using Amazon route 53 for my domain. Not sure it is harder compare to others though. Well, in my defense, it is just my <strong>second time</strong> buying a domain! (The first one was <del>jav…something.net</del>, oh forget it)</p>

<p>After 30 mins going nowhere, google strike me again, I found this <a href="http://sophiafeng.com/technical/2015/02/12/setting-up-custom-domain-name-with-github-pages-and-amazon-route-53/">Tutorial</a>. It’s fit perfectly with my case: Domain from Amazon and using github.io blog. Thanks bro!!</p>

<p><strong>Nice!</strong></p>

<h2 id="first-post">First post!</h2>
<p>Well if you’re planning to use Jekyll with Github and local review, I suggest you add those to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>/_site/
*/_site/
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Those was generated file, Github can do it for us.</p>

<h2 id="thing-left">Thing left?</h2>
