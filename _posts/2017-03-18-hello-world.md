## Getting started
As far as I remembered, I created a blog 2 year ago, when github "first" marketing about its feature github.io blog. I was excited and try it out right away. But umm... it was nothing more than one line __Hello world__ in the index.html file.

Ok, let skip that. Let create a brand-new one.

## Static blog

I've heard about this term before but haven't really spend time one it. After digging around 30 mins (sorry I lied about 60 mins stuff), I figured out some frameworks that I could use including in Haskell (language I've recently interested in).

But hey, we need server for that right?... Ok, go back with thing provide from github. Well, it's Jekyll.

Let try!

## Jekyll
Jekyll, in __Ruby__, okey...

Googled a little bit more and __bump__! Everything is settled.

Yeah, like super easy peasy. Just copy all the files (our just fork) the [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo and you're done!

Also I installed `bundle` and `gem` stuff so that I can see my post in my local machine (for typo problem, yeah I know my post still have typos and grammar errors in just about 100 words above, and... below).

## Custom domain
This one is hard. Because I'm using Amazon route 53 for my domain. Not sure it is harder compare to others though. Well in my defense, it just my second time buying a domain!

After 30mins going nowhere. Finally google strike me again, I found this [Tutorial](http://sophiafeng.com/technical/2015/02/12/setting-up-custom-domain-name-with-github-pages-and-amazon-route-53/). It's fit perfectly with my case: Domain from Amazon, using github.io blog.

__Nice!__
